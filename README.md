# CLI Health Metric Calculator

## Description
A console-based C application designed for calculating essential health metrics such as BMI, BMR, Body Fat Percentage, Daily Calorie Needs, and other fitness indicators. The system takes user inputs (age, weight, height, gender, activity level, etc.) and computes results using standard health formulas — all through a clean, menu-driven CLI interface.
This mini-project demonstrates:
Structured programming in C
Modular code using .c and .h files
File handling (optional logs or saved results)
User-interactive menu design
Clear input validation and formatted output
It is ideal for academic assignments or as a base for more advanced personal health applications.
